    <p>The Koenigsegg Jesko is a hypercar produced by Swedish automaker Koenigsegg, first revealed in 2019. <br> Named after the founder’s father, Jesko von Koenigsegg, the car is designed for extreme performance and cutting-edge technology. <br> The Jesko is powered by a 5.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine, delivering up to 1,600 horsepower when running on E85 fuel, making it one of the most powerful production cars ever built. <br> With this immense power, the Jesko can achieve incredible acceleration, with top speeds that push the limits of what a road car can achieve, potentially exceeding 300 mph. <br> The car features an innovative 9-speed transmission called the "Light Speed Transmission," which provides faster gear shifts and greater efficiency. <br> The Jesko’s design focuses on both aerodynamics and lightweight construction, with a carbon fiber body and active aerodynamics to optimize downforce and stability at high speeds. <br> Inside, the Jesko offers a minimalist yet luxurious cabin, featuring high-tech displays and customizable interior finishes. <br> The Koenigsegg Jesko is a true example of extreme engineering, blending raw power with advanced technology and pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the automotive world. <br></p>
