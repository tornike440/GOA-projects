    <h3>when were cars envented</h3>

    <p>Cars were created in the late 19th century. <br>
         The first true car was built in 1885 by a
          German inventor named Karl Benz. <br> It was called
           the Benz Patent-Motorwagen. <br> This car ran on an 
           engine powered by gasoline, unlike earlier vehicles 
           that were powered by steam or electricity. <br> In 1908, 
           Henry Ford made a big improvement by inventing the 
           assembly line. <br> This allowed cars to be made much 
           faster and cheaper, making them affordable for many people. <br>
            Over time, cars became faster, safer, and more advanced. <br>
             Today, cars are an essential part of daily life for millions of
              people around the world.

    <h3>when were motorcycles envented</h3>

    <p>Motorcycles were invented in the late 19th century.
         The first true motorcycle was created in 1885 by a 
         German inventor named Gottlieb Daimler. <br> He built a 
         small engine that was mounted on a wooden frame, which 
         is considered the first motorized bicycle. <br> Around the same
        time, Wilhelm Maybach helped improve the design. <br> In the 
        early 1900s, motorcycles became more popular and started
        being produced by companies like Harley-Davidson and Indian
        in the United States. <br> These early motorcycles had simple designs, but over time, 
        they became faster, safer, and more advanced. <br> Today,
         motorcycles are used for both transportation and recreation worldwide.</p>
