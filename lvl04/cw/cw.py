print("tornike")
#it is right becouse it is string but writing print(tornike) is wrong 
#because it gives it str value but it has latin icons in it


print("10")
#it gives 10 string value

print(10)
#it gives 10 integer value


#string and integer are dat types. str and int are there icons



#we also fave float(float) data type,



#only diiference between them is that you can add only the same type of data to eachother
#str+str=concatination-konkatinacia
#str+int-------does not exist-----------


a =2
b =5.7

print(a+b)


#you can add int to float and you will get float num




#we can do basic calculations on integers and floats

a =3.7
b =9.678

print(a+b)
#it will add one to enother

print(a-b)
#it will subtract second number from first

print(a*b)
#it will multiply oeachother











print(a/b)
