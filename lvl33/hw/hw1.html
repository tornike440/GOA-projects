            <h2>About World War 1</h2>
            <p>World War 1, also known as the Great War, was a global conflict that lasted from 1914 to 1918. It involved many of the world's great powers and was triggered by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria.</p>

            <h2>England</h2>
            <p>England, part of the United Kingdom, was a leading power in World War 1 due to its vast empire and strong navy. Its greatest strength lay in its ability to project power across the seas, enabling effective blockades against the Central Powers. Additionally, its industrial base and access to global resources gave it a significant advantage. However, England's weaknesses included reliance on overseas supplies and the initial under-preparation of its army for large-scale continental warfare. Over time, it overcame these challenges through collaboration with its allies and extensive recruitment efforts.</p>

            <h2>France</h2>
            <p>France was a major force in the war, driven by its desire to reclaim Alsace-Lorraine from Germany and protect its borders. Its military strategy was built around a strong defensive stance, exemplified by the construction of fortifications and the commitment to the Western Front. France's strengths included its resilient army, capable of holding critical positions against repeated German offensives. However, its proximity to Germany made it vulnerable to invasion, and the war took a heavy toll on its population and infrastructure.</p>

            <h2>Germany</h2>
            <p>Germany was the central power in the conflict, with a highly disciplined army and advanced military technology. Its strategic position in Europe allowed it to wage war on multiple fronts, and its early offensives demonstrated its capability to challenge the Allies. Nevertheless, Germany faced significant weaknesses, including a lack of resources due to naval blockades, overextension of its forces, and the eventual entry of the United States into the war, which tipped the balance against it.</p>

            <h2>United States</h2>
            <p>The United States initially remained neutral but entered the war in 1917, providing a crucial boost to the Allied Powers. Its strengths included a large and growing industrial base, fresh troops, and financial resources that helped sustain the Allies during the final phases of the war. Despite these advantages, the U.S. faced challenges in mobilizing its forces quickly and lacked the battlefield experience of European powers. Nevertheless, its intervention was decisive in breaking the stalemate and forcing Germany to seek an armistice.</p>
